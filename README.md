**Moonlit Echoes Êúà‰∏ãÂõûËÅ≤** is a UI theme designed for SillyTavern. It has been customized and refined based on my personal preferences to create a more modern, elegant, and minimalist interface while enhancing the user experience across both desktop and mobile platforms.

Moonlit Echoes was first released on the SillyTavern Discord server on November 25, 2024, and has been continuously updated with valuable feedback and support from the community. Eventually, to improve maintainability and ease of updates‚Äîand to satisfy my obsession with well-designed themes‚ÄîI developed this as a SillyTavern extension and made it open-source on GitHub.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
It is recommended to use the **latest version** of SillyTavern (either Release or Staging) along with Google Chrome.

### Installation Steps
1. **Install Moonlit Echoes Theme**: In the **SillyTavern Extension Manager**, use "Install from URL" and paste the following Git URL:
   ```
   https://github.com/RivelleDays/SillyTavern-MoonlitEchoesTheme
   ```
2. **Disable Thumbnail Scaling (Recommended for Clearer Avatars)**: Some message styles display character avatars in the background. Since SillyTavern enables thumbnail scaling by default, this may cause blurriness. To disable it, modify `config.yaml` (located at `/SillyTavern/config.yaml`) and set `thumbnails.enabled` to `false`:
   ```
   thumbnails:
     enabled: false
   ```
3. **Download and Enable the Theme (Optional)**: The Moonlit Echoes Theme extension is now usable upon installation. However, if you wish to use the styles shown in the preview images, download and import `Moonlit Echoes - by Rivelle.json` into User Settings and set it as the UI theme. Do not rename the file, or the extension may not function correctly.

### For SillyTavern Users via Termux üì±
If you‚Äôre using SillyTavern via Termux, here‚Äôs how you can modify `config.yaml`.

> [!Warning]
> I don‚Äôt have experience with Android devices or Termux, so I can‚Äôt answer related questions, test the steps, or guarantee results. The following methods are provided by other users.

> [!NOTE]
> You may find two config.yaml files inside the SillyTavern folder. Make sure to edit the one in the root directory: `/SillyTavern/config.yaml.` **Do NOT modify** `/SillyTavern/default/config.yaml` or anything inside the default folder.

### Method 1: Edit via Termux
1. Open Termux and enter: `cd SillyTavern`
2. Then, run: `nano config.yaml` to edit the file.

### Method 2: Use Material Files (Android File Manager)
1. **Open Material Files** > **Add Storage** > **Navigate to Termux** > **SillyTavern**
2. Within the SillyTavern directory, edit `config.yaml` directly

## Usage Guide

### How to Use the Moonlit Echoes Theme Preset?
The Moonlit Echoes theme preset is partially synced with the UI themes in SillyTavern. If there are matching options in the menu, switching either one will sync the settings accordingly.

However, the Moonlit Echoes theme preset is fundamentally separate from SillyTavern‚Äôs UI themes. The Moonlit Echoes Theme does NOT create or modify any SillyTavern UI themes.

### Import & Export
- Moonlit Echoes theme preset files follow the format `[Moonlit] PresetName.json` (e.g., `[Moonlit] Honey Cream.json`). There is a half-width space after `[Moonlit]`
- This does not affect functionality. You do **NOT** need to remove `[Moonlit] ` before importing‚Äîjust import the file directly
- If the imported preset does not sync with SillyTavern UI themes, **reload the page** or **select a different theme** to apply the changes
